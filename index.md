# Azure Brian's Blog

# Welcome!  

My goal for this blog is to serve as a repository for my experiences and thoughts as I use Microsoft Azure in the wild to provide robust, cloud-based solutions.  I hope the content will be stimulating for all who visit, including me :smile:, when I need to be reminded of stuff.
