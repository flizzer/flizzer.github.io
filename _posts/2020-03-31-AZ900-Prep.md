Greetings!  I wanted to do a blog post about studying for the [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900#certification-exams) exam.  I've technically been using Azure in my consulting position for a little over two years now.  However, I've really started leaning into it, and getting serious about learning it, within the last year.  My goal is to blend my administration background with my development career and pursuing Azure, and the solutions it provides, really seems like the ideal amalgamation of the two to me.  I'm passionate about doing IT right, and I'm also passionate about clean development practices.  So, I feel this is a pretty exciting time to be learning Azure.  I've been fortunate to get my hands dirty with real-world projects during this time.  However, like many of you I'm sure, I do want to formalize that experience by obtaining Azure-based certifications.  Whether it's angling for more money or just wanting others to take you seriously, there's no doubt these certications have the potential to unlock doors and change mindsets.

Given all of that, it seemed only natural to start at the ground floor, so to speak.  The Azure Fundamentals exam is aimed at a much broader audience than just us techies.  However, I feel it may be deceptively hard.  No, I don't think I'll have to configure a hybrid network connection or some crazy storage solution, but I also can't remember another exam that had the potential to cover such a breadth of material.  We all know that Azure is a beast and constanly changing with new offerings and updates to existing ones.  So, it's a little unnerving when I look at the range of material.
